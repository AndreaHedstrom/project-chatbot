# Chatbot project

This is a chatbot for those who find it difficult to choose paintings for their home.

## The problem

To understand Javascript (Had never worked with it before) and to find enough information to start was my problem with this project. The week I struggled with this
I have been googling, looking at tutorials and worked with classmates to figure things out. My plan this week was to read and watch all material the first days and then start with the project.
If I had more time I would try out some solutions to get a image in the end in the bot-bubble that matches the users choices. I need to figure out how to store the value when the user click diffrents buttons and make this become different posters for different choices.
